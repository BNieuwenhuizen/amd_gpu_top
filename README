amd_gpu_tools is a commandline program that gives an indication which blocks
of a GPU are busy.

This is done in a style similar to intel_gpu_top. However amd_gpu_top works
for AMD cards. Currently the only card that is tested and enabled is an AMD
TONGA card, but as most of the registers have not changed from CIK  it should
be doable to add those.

The software can be build with CMake and should be run from an user which has
the permissions to map a PCI memory range (for example root).

Dependencies:
 - pciaccess
 - CMake
 - a c++11 compiler
